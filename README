3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd path_to_project/tmp-glibc/work-shared/xilinx-zynq/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


4. Boot Instructions
====================

It is necessary to load the DTB (device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel uImage. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project, or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

	# bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel
	# make zynq-<Board Name>.dtb

Note: <Board Name> can be one of the ZYNQ boards' name, such as zc706, zc702.

The DTB can then be found in the directory:
  tmp-glibc/work/xilinx_zynq-wrs-linux-gnueabi/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-xilinx_zynq-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm/boot/dts/

Copy the DTB image to MMC/SD or QSPI Flash, and use u-boot's fatload command
to transfer it to the board before booting along with kernel image.


4.1 Boot from MMC/SD card
-------------------------

MMC/SD can be set as the default boot device for this board, and two
partitions have been created on the MMC/SD card by default. The first one
is a boot partition while the second is root filesystem, which can be
created by the fdisk command on the host machine.

Note: Refer to the README.hardware file for further details about the
configuration for setting MMC/SD as the first boot device.

4.1.1 Create two partitions and store the u-boot image
------------------------------------------------------
(1) Create two partitions on the MMC/SD card.

	# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

Suppose the device node for the MMC/SD card on the host machine is
/dev/mmcblk0.

(2) Create a VFAT filesystem on the first partition.

	# mkfs.vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1

(3) Copy the BOOT.BIN file to /dev/mmcblk0p1.

	# mkdir /mnt/sd
	# mount -t vfat /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cp BOOT.BIN /mnt/sd
	# umount /mnt/sd


4.1.2 Copy the kernel image and DTB image to /dev/mmcblk0p1
-----------------------------------------------------------

	# mkdir /mnt/sd
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cd <buildprj>/export/images/
	# cp zImage-xilinx-zynq.bin  /mnt/sd/zImage
	# cp zImage-zynq-<Board Name>.dtb /mnt/sd/devicetree.dtb
	# umount /mnt/sd


4.1.3 Decompress the MMC/SD root filesystem
-------------------------------------------

Assuming the second partition is used for the root filesystem, format it
with one of the popular filesystem types supported by Linux, such as
ext3. Then, mount and deploy the root filesystem image to the partition:

	# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/sd
	# cd <buildprj>/export/images/
	# tar -C /mnt/sd -jxf wrlinux-image-glibc-std-xilinx-zynq.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner
	# umount /mnt/sd


4.1.4 Boot from the MMC/SD card
-------------------------------

To boot from the MMC/SD card, use u-boot commands as follows:

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x2a00000 devicetree.dtb
	# fatload mmc 0 0x3000000 zImage
	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootwait
	# bootz 0x3000000 - 0x2a00000


4.2 Boot kernel from QSPI Flash
-------------------------------

4.2.1 QSPI Flash layout
-----------------------

The storage capacity of the QSPI flash on ZYNQ board is 16MB. The following
default partitions have been created on it:

	Start			End		Definition
	0x0			0x100000	qspi-fsbl-uboot
	0x100000		0x600000	qspi-linux
	0x600000		0x620000	qspi-device-tree
	0x620000		0xc00000	qspi-rootfs
	0xc00000		0x1000000	qspi-bitstream

CAUTION: Do not burn the bootloader partition for FSBL and u-boot. If
needed, you can burn the layout of the rest of the QSPI flash.

You also need to modify the QSPI flash device node in the following DTB source file to
reflect such changes:

	tmp-glibc/work-shared/xilinx-zynq/kernel-source/arch/arm/boot/dts/zynq-<Board Name>.dts

Then re-generate the DTB image as described above.


4.2.2 Save bootloader image to the bootloader partitions
--------------------------------------------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x100000 BOOT.BIN
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0 0x100000
	# sf write 0x100000 0 ${filesize}

Before writing to flash, you need to know its current layout. You can
get this information by running the 'cat /proc/mtd' command after booting
from an MMC/SD device or NFS server. When loading the BOOT.BIN image from 
the MMC/SD card, its file size will be automatically recorded in u-boot's 
"filesize" variable, which can be leveraged later.


4.2.3 Update DTB to support booting from QSPI flash
---------------------------------------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x2a00000 devicetree.dtb
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0x600000 0x20000
	# sf write 0x2a00000 0x600000 ${filesize}


4.2.4 Copy kernel image
-----------------------

	# mmcinfo
	# fatload mmc 0 0x3000000 zImage
	# sf probe 0
	# sf erase 0x100000 0x500000
	# sf write 0x3000000 0x100000 ${filesize}


4.2.5 Boot the kernel image
---------------------------

	# sf probe 0
	# sf read 0x2a00000 0x600000 0x20000
	# sf read 0x3000000 0x100000 0x500000
	# bootz 0x3000000 - 0x2a00000


4.2.6 Target Note
-----------------

Since the size of the qspi-rootfs partition is no more than 8 MB, it is too
small to accommodate a reasonable jffs2 filesystem, which can be as large as
60 MB.  Therefore, you cannot deploy a jffs2 filesystem on QSPI flash, and the
DTB defaults to mounting the root filesystem from the MMC/SD card.


4.3 NFS Root File System
------------------------

4.3.1 Prepare NFS and TFTP servers
----------------------------------

The files in the above example can be found in <buildprj>/export/images and
are copied to the NFS/TFTP server directory.


4.3.2 Boot from NFS root filesystem
-----------------------------------

To boot from an NFS image, execute use following u-boot commands:

	# setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.10
	# setenv serverip 192.168.1.1
	# setenv rootpath /nfsexport
	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath ip=dhcp
	# tftpboot 0x3000000 zImage-xilinx-zynq.bin
	# tftpboot 0x2a00000 zImage-zynq-<Board Name>.dtb
	# bootz 0x3000000 - 0x2a00000


5. Features
===========

5.1 DRM HDMI display
--------------------

5.1.1 Introduction
------------------

The specific adv7511 boot image BOOT.BIN built from bootloader/README for zc702
and zc706 include multimedia design to show the capabilities of HDMI display by
onboard HDMI interfaces.

5.1.2 Usage and verification
----------------------------

A glibc-std-sato filesystem is used to start matchbox on an HDMI monitor, so
the "--distros glibc-std-sato" parameter should be passd to setup.sh:
        ../setup.sh --distros glibc-std-sato ...

before rebuilding:
        bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-std-sato

5.2 Coresight operations on Xilinx-7000 series:
-----------------------------------------------

5.2.1 Introduction
------------------

The ARM CoreSight architecture defines four classes of CoreSight components:
access and control, trace source, trace link, and trace sink. Components
of the access and control class provide a user interface to access the
debug infrastructure through memory-mapped locations and JTAG (not involved).

The Xilinx 7000 series PS and PL can be debugged together as a complete system
using intrusive and non-intrusive debug techniques. This testing and debugging
capability is based on the ARM CoreSight and consists mostly of ARM-supplied
components, but also includes one Xilinx-supplied component (FTM Programmable
Logic Test and Debug).

Coresight is enabled using KERNEL_FEATURES_append in local.conf during
project configuration. The following command illustrates this step:

echo "KERNEL_FEATURES_append = \" features/coresight/coresight.scc\"" >> conf/local.conf

5.2.2 Usage and verification

5.3 IEEE 1588 PTP testing
-------------------------

5.3.1 Introduction
------------------

This testing method is based on the Linux PTP project, which provides a robust
implementation of the standard and uses the most relevant and modern API
offered by the Linux kernel. Only basic testing is done on this BSP because
accurate PTP testing is a bit complicated according to IEEE PTPv2.

5.3.2 Usage and verification
----------------------------

Two boards are necessary for this case, one will be used as master, another as slave.
The following commands show how to use PTP time in stamping mode based on the
peer delay (P2P) mechanism:

     master :
     root@128:/# ptpd2 -i eth0 -MV

     slave:
     root@128:/# ptpd2 -i eth0 -sV --section:kp=0.32 --section:ki=0.05

If master starts timing services succuessfully, then ptpd works fine.


5.4. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
------------------------------------

You can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create a properly
partitioned image on an SD card. The wic command generates partitioned images
from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
For more information about WIC, see:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.2/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images

This BSP supports SD card disk images.
After building the project, you will have a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/, for example:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-zynq/wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-zynq.wic

You can then write the output image to an SD card.

5.4.1 Burn images to SD card
----------------------------

To burn u-boot and WIC images to an SD card, you need to execute two steps:

1) Burn the WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-glibc-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-zynq.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

2) Create boot.bin for ZC702/6 board

Insert SD card into USB card reader, and then attach the USB card reader onto PC host.
If /dev/sdx1 partition is not mounted automatically, please mount it manually.
Then, deploy BOOT.BIN file for the specific board according to bootloader/README:

   # sudo cp path_to_BOOT.BIN path_to_sdx1_mount_point

5.4.2 Set u-boot env
--------------------

The board can boot automatically by setting the following uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootwait

=> setenv bootcmd "fatload mmc 0 ${netstart} zImage;fatload mmc 0 ${dtbnetstart} zImage-zynq-zc702.dtb; \
   bootz ${netstart} - ${dtbnetstart}"

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

Note: For xilinx-zynq pl, you should copy your boot.bin to replace the old version.
Note: Above environment variables example is based on zc702 board. For other boards, please
      do corresponding adjustment.

5.5 kexec and kdump
-------------------

You need to add feature/kexec support as follow:

	./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines xilinx-zynq --templates feature/kexec,feature/kdump

5.5.1 kexec
-----------

	kexec -l  /root/vmlinux --append="`cat /proc/cmdline`"
	kexec -e

5.5.2 kdump
-----------

Add crashkernel=256M@128M to the kernel cmdline
   kexec -p /boot/zImage --append="$your-bootcmd"
   echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger


5.6 FPGA bitstream infusion
---------------------------

5.6.1 introduction
------------------

The Zynq Programmable Logic can be programmed either using fsbl, U-Boot or
through Linux. Here is a link to provide the details about programming the
PL from Linux world:
  https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841645/Solution+Zynq+PL+Programming+With+FPGA+Manager

Notes:

The descriptions in subsequent sections refer to use of Device Tree Overlay
fragments with FPGA manager framework. It has to be noted that they are not
supported in official Xilinx SDK release, and WRLinux just keep them AS-IS
too. It means you should read and study the related tech documents to make
sure the match between your bitstream design logic and the overlay dtsi, or
it might malfunction your hardware devices.

5.6.2 Usage
-----------

Below sections describe steps just to infuse the default bitstream from SDK
v2018.3 without the extra considerations on dtsi match since they had already
been done by the vendor. Actually we can just skip over the dtsi part since
all interfaces have already been into Linux side.

Here, BSP prebuilt xilinx-zc702/6-2018.3/pre-built/linux/images/system.bit
is used to validate this function, which will be built into system.bit.bin
according to the link above.

	#> echo system.bit.bin > /sys/class/fpga_manager/fpga0/firmware
	fpga_manager fpga0: writing system.bit.bin to Xilinx Zynq FPGA Manager

	#> cat /sys/class/fpga_manager/fpga0/name
	Xilinx Zynq FPGA Manager

Notes:

The default firmware path is /lib/firmware, which you should deploy your FPGA
bitstream bin file into /lib/firmware before you echo the name of it into the
sys firmware interface. Please refer to the link above for more detailed info.
