4.1.1 Validated Board Info
--------------------------

This BSP is only validated in following environment. If you use this BSP
in a different environment it may possibly have some issues.

For ZYNQ ZC706 board:

	Processor:             ZYNQ XC7Z045
	Board Revision:        HW-Z7-ZC706 REV 2.0
	BootLoader:            U-Boot (ZC706 customized)
	BootLoader Version:    U-Boot 2024.01
	BOOT.BIN Version:      2024.1-zc706-release

For ZYNQ ZC702 board:

	Processor:             ZYNQ XC7Z020
	Board Revision:        HW-Z7-ZC702 REV 1.1
	BootLoader:            U-Boot (ZC702 customized)
	BootLoader Version:    U-Boot 2024.01
	BOOT.BIN Version:      2024.1-zc702-release

4.1.2 Specify boot medium
-------------------------

The ROM bootloader loads the secondary bootloader from the start or the first
partition of the selected device and executes it, which is indeed a BOOT.BIN
image that encapsulates the FSBL and u-boot properly.

Please refer to the 4.1 and 4.2 section of the README file for the details
about preparing the secondary bootloader on the MMC/SD card and QSPI Flash
respectively.


4.1.2.1 HW-Z7-ZC706 REV 1.2
---------------------------

1. Booting from SD card

The SW11 on the front panel is used for the configuration of booting sequence,
the default setting (00110) specifies to boot from the SD card:

	SW11.1 = OFF
	SW11.2 = OFF
	SW11.3 = ON
	SW11.4 = ON
	SW11.5 = OFF

2. Booting from QSPI flash

Shift SW11 setting to 00010 in order to boot from QSPI Flash:

	SW11.1 = OFF
	SW11.2 = OFF
	SW11.3 = OFF
	SW11.4 = ON
	SW11.5 = OFF


4.1.2.2 HW-Z7-ZC702 REV 1.1
---------------------------

1. Booting from SD card

The SW16 on the front panel is used for the configuration of booting sequence,
the default setting (00110) specifies to boot from the SD card:

	SW16.1 = OFF
	SW16.2 = OFF
	SW16.3 = ON
	SW16.4 = ON
	SW16.5 = OFF

2. Booting from QSPI flash

Shift SW16 setting to 00010 in order to boot from QSPI Flash:

	SW16.1 = OFF
	SW16.2 = OFF
	SW16.3 = OFF
	SW16.4 = ON
	SW16.5 = OFF


4.1.3 Jumper settings for various USB modes
-------------------------------------------

4.1.3.1 HW-Z7-ZC706 REV 1.2
---------------------------

For host mode:

	J10 ON
	J48 2-3
	J49 2-3
	J50 2-3
	J51 1-2

4.1.3.2 HW-Z7-ZC702 REV 1.1
---------------------------

For host mode:

	J7 ON
	J33 2-3
	J34 2-3
	J35 1-2
	J36 1-2


4.1.4 PL note:
--------------
The Zynq-7000 family is based on the Xilinx All Programmable SoC(AP SoC)
architecture. These products integrate a dual-core ARM CortexA9 MPCore based
processing system(PS) and Xilinx programmable logic(PL) in a single device.
The ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore CPUs are the heart of the PS, and there is a related
bit stream possibly by bootloader into PL catering for some specific apps.

So it is very important to make sure the proper PL's code embedded-in for the
related application testing. And the features appended by "(PL)" mean that they
fanned out from PL.
